I picked 4 warehouses to best divide reach by geography.
Breinigsville, PA 18031 - I selected this warehouse due to its close proximity to east coast cities.
Indianapolis, IN 46231 - I selected this location to service customers in the North and Midwest.
Union City, GA 30291 - I chose this warehouse to best service customers in the South.
Fort Worth, TX 76155 - I selected this location to serve customers in the West

This logistics network is the best it can be now and for the foreseeable future. Justification to this is that 70% of customers are receiving their orders in just 1 day. 90% are receiving in 2 days or less. The only outlier is the LA customer at 3 days because as of now that is the only customer that far west. You could put a warehouse closer to cut down time, but then you are adding cost just to supply that one customer. So that is a calculated decision that I made. I weighed time vs. cost.
